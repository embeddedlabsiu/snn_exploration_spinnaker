Getting started
===============

In a terminal window, type ``snntoolbox -h`` to get all command-line options.

The basic use is::

   snntoolbox <config-file> -t

The positional argument ``<config-file>`` specifies the path (including file
name) to a plain text file containing the settings to be used. Refer to
:doc:`configuration` for details on what this file looks like.

With ``-t``, we tell the program to stay in the terminal. Omitting this flag
opens the GUI (not actively developed).

See :doc:`examples` for typical usecases.
