Spiking neural network conversion toolbox
=========================================

The SNN conversion toolbox contains functions to transform rate-based artificial
neural networks into spiking neural networks, and to simulate them. The source
code can be found on `GitHub`_. See also the accompanying `article <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00682/abstract>`_.
