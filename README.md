## Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Exploration on Neuromorphic Hardware (SpiNNaker)
Exploration of hardware dependent parameters on SpiNNaker 

# Disclaimer

This work is based on the SNN conversion toolbox (SNN-TB) that transforms a rate-based
artificialgiven neural network that is decribed in a common deep-learning framework (Keras/TF and others) into the equivalent spiking representation
and provides an interface to deploy the SNN on the SpiNNaker board.
